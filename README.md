**Time Spent:** 8 hrs coding and 8 hrs studying concepts

**What I Learned:** The basics of javascript. The DOM was scary at first but not as bad as I thought to grasp.

**What Was Difficult:** Following the syntax of javascript without errors. It took time to get things formatted to actually run correctly despite the code being okay.
